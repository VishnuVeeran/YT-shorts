# Used by the application to interact with the Gemini API (or its simulation)
# Copy this file to .env.local and replace with your actual API key.
API_KEY="YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY_HERE"

# Note: For Vite applications, environment variables prefixed with VITE_ are
# exposed to the client-side code by default. If API_KEY is used server-side
# or needs to be explicitly exposed, ensure your Vite configuration and
# process.env access in App.tsx are aligned with how Vite handles env vars.
# The current App.tsx uses `process.env.API_KEY`, which might require
# `define: { 'process.env.API_KEY': JSON.stringify(process.env.API_KEY) }`
# in vite.config.ts if not using VITE_ prefix.
# For simplicity of this exercise, we assume direct access or VITE_ prefix if needed.
